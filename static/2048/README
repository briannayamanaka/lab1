Vim related Questions:

  (Q) 1) In vim, what command can you use to find and replace every instance of
      the word fun with amazing? How would you replace only the first instance
      of fun with amazing in each line?

Unix/Linux Questions:

  (Q) 2) Suppose you are currently inside a directory and in there you want to
      make a new directory called fooDir. And inside fooDir, you want another
      directory called barDir. Using only a single mkdir command, how can you
      create a directory called fooDir with a directory called barDir inside it?

  (A) mkdir -p fooDir/barDir

  (Q) 3) Give an example of how you would use a wildcard character (you can use
      it with whichever command you want like rm, cat, ls, cp, etc). Describe
      what happens after you use it.

  (A) javac *.java
      //wildcard commands apply the passed command to all files of the
      //specified extension following the wildcard charactere

  (Q) 4) How can you run gvim through the command line to open all Java source
      code files in the current directory, each file in its own tab?

  (A) gvim -p *.java
      //I use vim, and have never used gvim. However this works in vim so
      //I am assuming it works in gvim.

  (Q) 5) What does the keyword static mean in regards to methods? Provide an
      example use of a static method.

  (A) In regards to methods, the keyword static means that they can be called
      using the classname. ie if you have static method dance in class Foo, you 
      can call it using: Foo.dance()
      You do not need to create an instance of the class to call a static method.
      Static methods can also not be overridden and are shared across the whole
      class.

Java Questions

  (Q) 6) A high school student is trying to write a Java program that will draw
      different shapes and in different possible colors. To do this, she has
      written just one Java class called ShapeDrawer, which contains all the
      necessary methods like drawRedCircle(), drawBlueCircle(),
      drawYellowSquare(), drawGreenSquare(), and so on. Using object-oriented
      terminology, describe how you can help the student improve her design.

  (A) To begin with, instead of having one Java class called ShapeDrawer that
      draws, fills in color,chooses the shape she should have multiple classes
      designated for each shape and different methods. To be able to have the
      same methods in each of the specific shape classes, she should create
      one super class that creates a basic shape. The methods in that class will
      not be called, but rather just set the format and rules for the more specific
      shape classes that will extend this general basic shape class. Each specific
      shape class should have a method that way you can pass in different colors
      for different circles of different sizes. Since the methods won't be called
      they can be astract.
